Howdy Y'all!

It's finally here! The Yellow belt! Your task is to recreate the <image> using HTML, CSS, and the images provided. You have until Sunday midnight to send me an email titled "<Your Name> Yellow Belt Exam" with all the files for your submission zipped and attached.

Guidelines:
- Be as detailed as you can
- Reproduce text as accurately as you can 
- Alignment MATTERS
- Style counts
- You may use the platform and the internet as resources to complete the exam, not students, TAs, or Instructors
- Contact me with any questions, preferably before Saturday

With, that expect the usual recap and algorithm emails later today!

Good Luck!
Alan
