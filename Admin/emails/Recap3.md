Hey Everybody!

Phew! What a week! We learned about JavaScript! That is pretty awesome! What's more we started using a JavaScript library called jQuery to help us manipulate the DOM. This weekend should be full of jQuery and JavaScript and moving pieces. I encourage you if you feel 'on top of things' to try experimenting with your own.

Recap!

  - I am interested in doing some kind of collaborative project on Wednesday that might be a game or simulation or something where we just see what we can make happen in a few hours working with jQuery and HTML and CSS.

3) What should I do this weekend?
- Feel good with jQuery and JavaScript!
  - JS Circles from JS Objects & DOM is a GREAT assignment
  - jQuery functions is a great assignment
  - Contact Card is kinda the 'end of the line' for assignments. Everything after that point is ~optional, you should be looking into stuff that looks interesting to you. APIs, games, front-end frameworks, RWD, github pages, etc.
