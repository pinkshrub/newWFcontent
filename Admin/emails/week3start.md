Hey All!

It's week 3! Time to JavaScript! Thank you to everybody that responded to the weekly recap email. Also hope y'alls' yellow belts went well, expect results to have trickled out by Wednesday. REGARDLESS FO HOW WELL YOU DID, it is Javascript this week, and it is going to be no good if you are focused on HTML and CSS catching-up and JS. Please do your best to focus on the JS and JQ content. Today please try to cover the basics so that tomorrow we can focus on control structures, functions, and objects. Wednesday will have a walkthrough and a video where I build out some of JQuery from scratch. Thursday we are going to be hopping into JQuery to add some responsiveness to our pages, I'd like to focus on the fun parts, so please try to be comfortable with the content from the Wednesday video before lecture. Also on Thursday will be a demo by TAs going through some algorithms. Please be active on slack and ask questions of the TAs as you move through this section.

This is what we will be working on this week!
Monday:
  - Algorithm Challenges email
  - Weekly email with video
Tuesday:
  - JQuery lecture
Wednesday:
  - YB exam grades should be back
Thursday:
  - AJAX and APIS
Friday:
  - Recaps on recaps

Cheers y'all!
