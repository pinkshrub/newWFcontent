  RANDOM CLOSING THOUGHTS
  So, a few last little random thoughts. The first is that if you are planning on doing a chunk of coding this weekend(or, really, at any point this month) where you know you will be coding for many hours and have kinda pushed some stuff off, you are putting a lot of stress on yourself to take care of business. That's ok! Stress isn't bad. What I want to encourage you to do though, is maybe tweak the 20 minute rule to a 10 minute rule(Weekend cramfests ONLY!). It will help you conserve willpower to fight through bugs and issues longer. Also, every 45-55 minutes *try* to remember to take a small walk and get a change of scenery. Also, help each other out! I know I've been uber-repetitive this week, but it is important and effective. If I didn't honestly think it would make everybody more successful I wouldn't harp on it so much. Only 2 more things! A reminder to email me a response! I will read all of them AAAAAND lastly, I will reiterate that we have covered a ton of ground this week. But know that we will take a chill pill early this week and dive further into CSS & HTML, you have all the information needed to pass your Yellow Belt, just gotta get the repetitions in! So don't panic if you feel a tad(or ton) overwhelmed right now, it is normal and I am optimistic we can survive it. "Strengh through Struggle" <- #DojoLife

  With that, have a fantastic and educational weekend everybody! Looking forward to next week!
