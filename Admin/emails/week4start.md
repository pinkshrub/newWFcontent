Hey All!

It is week 4! The last week of Web Fun. I hope everybody had a nice weekend working on practicing JQuery. This week is going to be slightly slower than last week. We will examine asynchronous calls using AJAX and jQuery on Tuesday and then on Thursday look at RWD and CSS frameworks. Thank you to everybody that responded to the weekly recap email this weekend and that got me a yellow belt. A lot of people out there feeling the JavaScript burn, that is ok! Remember, JS is the syntax that we use to describe instructions for our browser. jQuery is just some pre-built JavaScript that shortens the amount of code we have to write by wrapping useful DOM manipulations/methods in easier to use syntax.



As for what we are doing this week:

Monday:
  - Holiday life!
Tuesday:
  - Walkthrough 4pm PST JS Circles
  - Lecture 5+7 AJAX + API
  - 6pm Sess - Github ContactCard
Wednesday:

Thursday:
  - Demo 4pm by TA
  - Lecture 5+7 CSS frameworks
  - 6pm Sess.
Friday:
  - Algo recap
  - Recap email w/ Python intro video

Alright y'all, have fun this week and I'll catch you later today!

Cheers,
Alan
