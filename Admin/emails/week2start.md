Hey All!

Welcome to week 2 of Web Fundamentals, where we will be doing the last touches on our  CSS learning and ready for the Yellow Belt. Heads up, you will want to have a look at the platform regarding JS in advance. Thanks to everybody that responded to the recap email. Some common themes in the responses came up, so let me address them. First is what and why and how to approach algorithms/how all of our pieces fit together:

HTML, CSS, and JS are the primary technologies that present a client-side(browser) experience. We've already touched on HTML and CSS, they are just rules for describing and presenting information. JS is a bit trickier in that we all of a sudden have to tell computers to do stuff in a certain order, without relying too much on the browser to do much for us. Algorithms require us to think procedurally. This procedural thinking is going to be carried over to every other stack you learn at the Dojo, and is the main reason to do algorithms. Algorithms are going to be what helps you get better at turning "If the game isn't over I need to update the display every 15 milliseconds" into "while(!gameOver()){setInterval(displayGame(), 15)}". As far as what to work on, 1) Do not work in algo-app from pre-bootcamp 2) Work on Algorithms I chapter on platform or Algorithm Email challenges. As for how to work on algorithms, I'd try and hit one from the Algorithm I/eBook during the time I'm waiting for help while using the 20 minutes rule. Or if you only are going to be able to put in 30-40 minutes, maybe you won't be able to make a ton of progress on a CSS assignment, so an algorithm or 2 would be great. As far as algos go, you can turn them in on the platform if you'd like, but I think putting ones that you are looking for help on available in your github dojo repo would be best for sharing. And lastly talk about them in the algo channel, especially if you are having interpretation issues/where to start. The more of that we can get into the channel, the better.

The other 2 things I saw in responses were how to get better at CSS layouts and how all the pieces fit together. As far as CSS layouts go, we will look into that more tomorrow and also the activity tomorrow is going to be splitting into groups and writing stylesheets for another website. (next week we will use jquery to make it so you can click a button to change the stylesheet the webpage uses :P) This is so you can all share and learn from each others' CSS workflow/approach. As far as how to balance lectures and activities with everything else, show up and participate in lectures. The activities afterwards are 100% optional, but I have tried to make them something that is relevant, even if it looks like another assignment.

Phew! So with that, a quick outline of what we will touch on this week:
Monday:
- Algorithm Challenge Email

Tuesday: CSS - tips/tricks/some more properties
- This is going to be probably fairly short ~30minutes-ish we will talk about how to CSS 'better', some approaches for writing CSS, and touch on the position property.

Thursday: JavaScript - intro to JS
- This is going to be a mind-blower. I'd like to NOT have to go over what a conditional/loop/variable is and focus on talking about scope, PbR, callbacks, nested objects, chained calls

Friday:
- Recaps on Recaps

Cheers Y'All!
