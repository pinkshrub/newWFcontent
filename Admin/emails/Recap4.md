Hey All!

Woot! We made it through the wilderness! Web Fundamentals is now done. I think it is important that you take some time to reflect on your experiences so far at some point this weekend. Think about what you've learned and accomplished. If you've struggled, think about what you can learn from your experience to keep being better at learning. I think it is really nice at this point to read web development articles from the web and appreciate how much of it you comprehend now (https://medium.mybridge.co/@Mybridge). With that being said, Python awaits!

3) What should I do this weekend?
**Remember no instuction(lectures) next week**
- If you haven't passed your YB, go ahead and give it one more shot at some point. It isn't worth your time to take more than 1 attempt at this point.
- After you've taken/passed a yellow belt exam go ahead and work on:
  - Understand APIs and AJAX
    - pokedex &/or GoT
  - Do more complex and FUN stuff in JS
    - pacman &/0r 1942
  - Create your own stuff!
    - static portfolio page on gihub pages
    - build your own broswer game
- Stay active on Slack throughout the whole off week. This is a tremendous opportunity to catch up and work with your classmates on assignments and or special projects.
- Maybe Post an interesting article you read this weekend related to Web Development in the general channel on slack?

Have a great weekend and off week y'all! I really hope you put some cool stuff up on slack and github this week. If people have sorta small projects they'd like to work on reach out to instructors and TAs

Cheers!
