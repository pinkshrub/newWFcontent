Hey All!

Welcome to week 2 of Web Fundamentals, where we will be doing the last touches on our  CSS learning and ready for the Yellow Belt. Heads up, you will want to have a look at the platform regarding JS in advance. Thanks to everybody that responded to the recap email. Some common themes in the responses came up, so let me address them. Let me try and address what and why and how to approach algorithms/how all of our pieces fit together:

HTML, CSS, and JS are the primary technologies that present a client-side(browser) experience. We've already touched on HTML and CSS, they are just rules for describing and presenting information. JS is a bit trickier in that we all of a sudden have to tell computers to do stuff in a certain order, without relying too much on the browser to do much for us. Algorithms require us to think procedurally. This procedural thinking is going to be carried over to every other stack you learn at the Dojo, and is the main reason to do algorithms. Algorithms are going to be what helps you get better at turning "If the game isn't over I need to update the display every 15 milliseconds" into "while(!gameOver()){setInterval(displayGame(), 15)}". As far as what to work on, 1) Do not work in algo-app from pre-bootcamp 2) Work on Algorithms I chapter on platform or Algorithm Email challenges. As for how to work on algorithms, I'd try and hit one from the Algorithm I/eBook during the time I'm waiting for help while using the 20 minutes rule. Or if you only are going to be able to put in 30-40 minutes, maybe you won't be able to make a ton of progress on a CSS assignment, so an algorithm or 2 would be great. As far as algos go, you can turn them in on the platform if you'd like, but I think putting ones that you are looking for help on available in your github dojo repo would be best for sharing. And lastly talk about them in the algo channel, especially if you are having interpretation issues/where to start. The more of that we can get into the channel, the better. Final Caveat, Algorithms should be secondary to your HTML and CSS learning this week.

Other common questions were some form of where should I be/am I far enough? The answer is that at this point, you should probably have taken a look at the CSS Portfolio and About Python assignments. I'll be doing a walk through of Portfolio on Wednesday this week at 2pm PST(will be recorded). This week is all about getting ready for the yellow belt exam, so focus on CSS assignments. If you finish the CSS assignments, do optional assignments. When you feel good about CSS and ready for YB, go ahead and move onto javascript stuff on platform.

Phew! So with that, a quick outline of what we will touch on this week:
Monday:
- Algorithm Challenge Email

Tuesday: CSS - tips/tricks/some more properties
- This is going to be probably fairly short ~30minutes-ish we will talk about how to CSS 'better', some approaches for writing CSS, and touch on the position property.

Wednesday:
- CSS Portfolio walkthrough

Thursday: Office Hours & YB thoughts
- We are just going to talk about things for the YB.

Friday:
- Recaps on Recaps
- YELLOW BELT EMAIL

Weekend:
- TAKE YELLOW BELT EXAM
Cheers Y'All!
