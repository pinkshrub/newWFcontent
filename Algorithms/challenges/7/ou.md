Hey all,

Weekly Algorithm Challenges!

#1
Countdown By Fours
Log positive numbers starting at 2016, counting down by fours (exclude 0), without a FOR loop.  

Flexible Countdown This is based on the earlier “Countdown By Fours”. You will be given 3 parameters: lowNum, highNum, mult. Print multiples of mult, from highNum down to lowNum, using a FOR. Given (2,9,3), print 9 6 3 (on successive lines).  

The Final Countdown This is based on earlier “More Flexible Countdown”. Parameter names are not as helpful, but problem is essentially identical; don’t be thrown off! Given 4 parameters (param1,param2,param3,param4), print multiples of param1, starting at param2 and extending to param3. One exception: if a multiple is equal to param4, then skip (don’t print) that one. Do this using a WHILE. Given (3,5,17,9), print 6,12,15 (which are all of the multiples of 3 between 5 and 17, except for the value 9).

#2
Lance is writing his opus: a tome of beat poetry. Always looking for a good rhyme, he seeks words ending with the same letters. Write a function that, given a word array, returns the largest common suffix (word-end). For inputs ["deforestation", "citation", "conviction", "incarceration"], return "tion" (not a very creative starting point). If it is ["nice", "ice", "baby"], return ""

#3
Given number, return whether it is prime. Prime numbers are only evenly divisible by themselves and 1.  

Extend the isNumberPrime(num) function at left to count the primes equal or less than given integer.

#4
Earth is under invasion by blob aliens! You have been tasked with developing an algorithm that efficiently decides when to fire alien removing bombs. These bombs can destroy aliens that weigh less than 50 tons. Aliens adapt over time! Every hour, the two smallest aliens combine and form a less small alien. Given an array of alien weights less than 50, return how many hours you could wait to use your alien bomb to remove all the aliens.

Have fun and see ya on slack
