Hey all!

Algorithms challenges, remember you might not be ready for all of 'em, but give them a look!

1) Reverse Array!
Given array, write a function that reverses values, in-place. Example: reverse([3,1,6,4,2]) returns same array, containing [2,4,6,1,3].

2) Prev. lengths!
You are passed an array containing strings. Working within that same array, replace each string with a number – the length of the string at previous array index – and return the array.  

3) Remove duplicates from an array
Remove array duplicates. Do not alter original. Return new array with results ‘stable’ (original order). For [1,2,1,3,4,2] return [1,2,3,4].  

Second: work ‘in-place’ in given array. Alter order if needed (stability is not required). Ex.: [1,2,1,3,4,2] could become [1,2,4,3].  

Third: make it in-place and stable.  
 
Fourth: eliminate any second (inner) loop.

4) Max of SubArray sums
Given a numerical array that is potentially very long, return the maximum sum of values from a subarray. Any consecutive sequence of indices in the array is considered a subarray. Create a function that returns the highest sum possible from these subarrays. Given [1,2,-4,3,-2,3,-1], you should return 4 (for subarray [3,-2,3]), and given [-1,-2,-4,-3,-2,-3], return 0 (for []). This problem has many possible implementations. Which do you prefer & why?

Cheers!
