### Lecture Outline
- Administrative
- Context
- R&R Cycle
  - [The Web](https://docs.google.com/presentation/d/1JiRy4upli5WgCdKlk-N7JhAtgvaoUTGlTrvRHa9PCdY/edit#slide=id.p)
    - Relies on a few things
      - HTML hypertext markup language
        - most common language that web pages are written in
      - HTTP Hypertext transfer protocol
        - protocol for passing HTML(and other data) around
        - oversees the data exchange between client and Server
        - relies on TCP(transmission control protocol)
          - breaks down and assembles information as it moves about
          - IP allows TCP to move between networks
    - 1 URL is parsed
      - human readable IP address  
          - browser sees if location is cached, else goes to DNS
            - DNS (domain name server) is phonebook of IP addresses
        - [protocol]://[host]/[request-URI]
          - protocol tells server how to respond
          - host tells where to go
          - request-URI tells server where to go
          - Browser forms HTTP request
        - provides a token denoting type of request
          - GET v POST (where info is)
        - header
          - includes info about IP of client
    - 2 Request is sent!
      - Users machine opens a socket connection to IP address
      - HTTP request is sent to host + machine waits
      - Request may get sent to DNS
      - Server receives request
    - 3 Response
      - checks header for relevant info, GET or SET
      - server finds relevant info and returns a status code, response headers, and requested data to browser through socket connection
        - status codes
          - 200 is good
          - 400 is bad
    - 4 Browser receives response
      - Parses HTML document into DOM, which is displayed on screen
        - External resources are requested
        - Style is parsed
        - JS is parsed and executed
      - DOM is constructed and so is a visual representation
      - browser renders the frames generated by DOM

- HTML
  - structures the webpage using meaningful tags,
    - House material analogy I think is relevant
      - railing, door, beam are all 'wood' but have dif. semantic meaning
  - Tags get interpreted as content
    - `<!DOCTYPE html>` declares that this is an html5 document. Use this always.
    - `<html>` starts a document and the corresponding `</html>` ends it
    - `<head>` contains information about the page
    - `<body>` contains the content displayed
    -> this is a good point to make an html doc
  - Most-used tags are on the learning platform.  
    - We teach the <b>20%</b> that builds the <b>80%</b> of sites
    - What's nytimes.com made up of? Nothing crazy!
  - Order stuff gets put on the page
  - LEGO concept/semantic HTML
    - def of semantic: "relating to meaning in language or logic"
    - Semantic tag usings...
