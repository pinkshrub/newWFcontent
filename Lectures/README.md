# Lecture Content

## Overview
In this repository I have the outlines for each of the lectures for the Online Program's Web Fundamentals stack. Lectures will contain 30-40 minutes worth of material that is intended to be delivered to expand on platform content. Smaller details and information covered on the platform are expected to be covered by students. After each lecture there will be time for either working in groups on an activity or for individual coding. In addition to lectures their is material for the weekend bonus videos and suggestions for activities to do after each lecture. Also included will be resources relevant to material that should be helpful.
